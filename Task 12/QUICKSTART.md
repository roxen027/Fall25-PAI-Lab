## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Port 5000 Already in Use

Change port in `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, port=8000)  # Use 8000 or any available port
```

### Missing Data Files

Run the Jupyter notebook first:
```bash
jupyter notebook Task12.ipynb
```
Execute all cells to generate required files.

### Module Not Found Error

Make sure virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📱 Accessing from Other Devices

To access from mobile/tablet on the same network:

1. Find your computer's IP address:
   - **Windows**: `ipconfig` → IPv4 Address
   - **macOS/Linux**: `ifconfig` → inet

2. On mobile device, visit: `http://<YOUR_IP>:5000`

---

## 💡 Tips

- **Better Results**: Use specific terms (e.g., "Prophet Muhammad wisdom" instead of just "hadith")
- **Performance**: Start with fewer results (5-10) for faster loading
- **Mobile**: Use portrait mode for best experience
- **Search Time**: Processing takes ~100-200ms; be patient
